7. **Demo Screenshots**: Show ü¶Ü snake head, + power-ups, scoring
8. **Conclusion**: Learning outcomes and technical skills gained

#### E. Record Demo Video (5 minutes)
- Show the working console game
- Demonstrate WASD controls (both cases work)
- Show snake head (ü¶Ü), body (o), food (*), power-ups (+)
- Demonstrate fast-paced automatic movement
- Collect food to show growth and scoring
- Collect power-ups to show bonus points (+25)
- Show level progression
- Explain the code structure and algorithms used

### 3. SUBMISSION PREPARATION
